		<p>Yeah, that's a David Cage game. Congratulations.</p>
		<p>You have a few choices at this point. You can lament the poorly executed attempts at story-driven gameplay, or maybe go out an play something better.</p>
		<ul>
			<li data-slug="shower-scene">
				<span class="comment">Unnecessary shower scene as an excuse to feature nude character models.</span>
				<span class="retort">Ellen Page was considering legal action against Quantic Dream after a nude model of her character was discovered in the files of Beyond: Two Souls.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="game-design-failure">
				<span class="comment">"Game over screens are a failure of the game designer"</span>
				<span class="retort">A scene where a character is in mortal peril, with the player required to navigate the character to safety, but is impossible to fail.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="racial-stereotype">
				<span class="comment">A character described solely in terms of overtly racial sterotypes.</span>

			</li>
			<li data-slug="supernatural-forces">
				<span class="comment">Ghosts/Aliens/Wizards/Elves/Souls/Any supernatural force, out of nowhere.</span>

			</li>
			<li data-slug="androids-are-made-of-people">
				<span class="comment">Shock revelation that the androids are made from human brains or conciousnesses.</span>
				<span class="retort">Android fiction is an analogy to human slavery.  Removing the "artificial" from AI also removes the analogy, making the setting pointless.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="awkward-sex-scene">
				<span class="comment">Consensual sex scene involving at least one android, because they have feelings now.</span>
				<span class="retort">There are other ways for a character to express emotion, especially if they have only recently gained the ability to do so.  This will not be explored.</span>
			</li>
			<li data-slug="sexualized-violence">
				<span class="comment">Uneccessary Rape Peril</span>

        <span class="comment">A reference to real world civil rights.</span>

     </li>
     <li data-slug="reference-to-previous-game">
        <span class="comment">A prop/environment/character/poster from a previous Quantic Dream game.</span>
        <span class="retort">A lot of talented people (artists, developers, modellers, etc.) work on these games, and they are justifiably proud of their work.  This one is for them.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="noble-homeless-people">
        <span class="comment">Homeless people are paragons of selflessness and virtue.</span>
        <span class="retort">This is pretty condescending.  Let homeless people be dirtbags!</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="pity-the-sexbots">
        <span class="comment">Pity the sexbots.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="electric-soul">
        <span class="comment">The androids are found to have "souls", or a related "miracle" occurs.</span>
        <span class="retort">This studio is obsessed with souls, like two of the games have "Soul" in the title.</span>

      <li data-slug="ro-babies">
        <span class="comment">Android birth or pregnancy.</span>
        <span class="retort">People are conditioned to feel protective of children.  Let's exploit that.</span>

      <li data-slug="suprise-android">
        <span class="comment">A human character turns out to be an android.</span>

      <li data-slug="vr-chat">
        <span class="comment">Depiction of a virtual realm of shared android conciousness and emotion.</span>

      <li data-slug="space">
        <span class="comment">A setting in space, which wasn't necessary.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="mundane-action">
        <span class="comment">A scene that lovingly renders a mundane action.</span>
        <span class="retort">These scenes exist as tutorials for the control system, but in the context of a narrative story are meaningless.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="magical-ethnic-stereotype">
        <span class="comment">A wise, elder, ethnic sterotype gives advice.</span>
        <span class="retort">This could be a generic cliche for any work of fiction, it shows up with alarming regularity.</a>.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="cyberpunk-resistance">
        <span class="comment">The android resistance cell is made of of quirky punk stereotypes who have one personaility trait each.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="robo-traitor">
        <span class="comment">A main character turns out to be working for the evil human authorities</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="opiates-for-masses">
        <span class="comment">Robot drugs are used to keep the androids down.</span>
        <span class="retort">Drug law is used to oppress races in the real world, but this should be an example of the drug itself being an agent of control.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="angry-mob">
        <span class="comment">A character is "outed" as an android, and a mob forms to kill them for no reason.</span>
        <span class="retort">This will be an excuse for an extended chase sequence.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="monologue">
        <span class="comment">Internal monolgue that conveys no useful information.</span>
        <span class="retort">"I'm Barry, and this is my story".  No useful info here, doesn't count if it is expository.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="nierly-there">
        <span class="comment">A theme or topic that was addressed with more sensitivity and depth in Nier:Automata</span>

      <li data-slug="chain-gang">
        <span class="comment">A literal android chain gang.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="robo-slurs">
        <span class="comment">Use of a slur to "dehumanise" androids. (e.g. gearheads)</span>
        <span class="retort">"Bonus" points if it sounds roughly similar to a real-world ethnic slur.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="child-actors">
        <span class="comment">Terrible child voice actors.</span>
        <span class="retort">Voice acting is hard work, and this isn't an attack against the children involved. Rather, the need to use them in the first place.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="omg-seriously">
        <span class="comment">Any other space on the card, but exagerrated to the point where it is actually offensive.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="suprise-human">
        <span class="comment">An android turns out to be a human.</span>
        <span class="retort">Shocking twist!  Again.  Also counts if the android has a human soul or conciousness based on memories or something.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="direct-literary-reference">
        <span class="comment">Use of quote from a famous person or literary figure.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="modified-literary-reference">
        <span class="comment">A character has line which is a literary quote, but modified for the setting.</span>
        <span class="retort">The coward's quote, because you don't have to attribute the original quote, but you assume that you are capable of producing something equally profound.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="creators-guilt">
        <span class="comment">The inventor of the androids expresses guilt, or wonders if they did the right thing.</span>

      </li>
      <li data-slug="villian-upgrade">
        <span class="comment">An antagonist goes from somewhat sympathetic to cartoonishly evil, for no real reason.</span>

      <li data-slug="setting-history">
        <span class="comment">This game has nothing to do with the city of Detroit.</span>
        <span class="retort">Example: Detroit will have gone through an economic boom with the construction of androids centred there, but now the androids are the poverty-stricken underclass!</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="hate-crime">
        <span class="comment">Android hate crime as a background element.</span>
        <span class="retort">Possibly a main character witnesses it, an has an emotive moment, with the player being given a choice to intervene.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="awkward-romance">
        <span class="comment">Zero chemistry, straight romance.</span>
        <span class="retort">It is doubtful if it is even possible to avoid this in an interactive medium.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="special-character">
        <span class="comment">A main character is special or unique in some way.</span>
        <span class="retort">Happens a lot, usually with some sort of supernatural jusitification.  Here, the character could be a prototype model or something.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="awkward-dialogue">
        <span class="comment">"That's not how people talk"</span>

      <li data-slug="huge-apartment">
        <span class="comment">A ridiculously huge apartment or house.</span>
        <span class="retort">This is almost necessary from a gameplay prespective, as large environments have less obstacles and are therefore easier to navigate.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="male-saviour">
        <span class="comment">"Strong, Independant Woman" needs to be saved by a man.</span>
        <span class="retort">This isn't even specific to Quantic Dream games.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="blade-runner">
        <span class="comment">Reference to Blade Runner.</span>
        <span class="retort">A direct or visual reference to the movie, not the book "Do Androids Dream of ELectric Sheep?".</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="ineffectual-cops">
        <span class="comment">Police or authority figures who cannot solve crimes or complete tasks by themselves.</span>

      <li data-slug="emotive-suicide">
        <span class="comment">An appeal to the player's emotions through a suicide attempt.</span>
        <span class="retort">Mawkish and vulgar, when you can't get the emotional response you want, just have someone kill themselves.</span>
      </li>
      <li data-slug="evil-androids">
        <span class="comment">The androids were evil, all along.</span>
        <span class="retort">So this undercuts any attempt to cover civil rights, if your oppressed group is actually inherently evil.</span>

        <span class="comment">Drowning water peril.</span>
        <span class="retort">This always come up.</span>

        <span class="comment">"This wouldn't have happened if you'd built them with a failsafe!"</span>
